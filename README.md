## üìö Project Description

VLibrary is a digital library management system that allows users to organize and track their personal book collections, reading progress, and reviews.  
The platform offers a secure, modern REST API built with Java and Spring Boot, following best practices for API design, architecture, and security.

## üöß Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-31 20:34:40 UTC

VLibrary is currently **under active development**.  
The foundational features are implemented and being improved.

### ‚úÖ Main Features

- **User authentication** with JWT-based security
- **User management** (registration, password change, profile)
- **Genre, author, and book management**
- **Integration with Google Books API** for searching and importing books
- **Personal library**: add books, update reading status, remove from library
- **Review system**: users can review and rate books in their library
- **Advanced search and filtering** for books, authors, genres, users, reviews
- **Interactive API documentation** via Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Postman collection** for easy API testing

## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap & Next Steps

- **Centralized API Exception Handling:**  
  Implement a global exception handler to provide consistent and informative error responses for all API endpoints, improving developer experience and maintainability.
- **Enhanced user profile features**
- **Security improvements and refactoring**
- **More detailed error handling and user feedback**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- Java 24
- Spring Boot 3.5.3
- Spring Security
- JWT Authentication
- Spring Data JPA
- PostgreSQL
- Maven
- Lombok
- SpringDoc OpenAPI / Swagger UI
- Postman

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

VLibrary follows a standard layered architecture pattern:

### Key Components

- **API Layer**: REST controllers for authentication endpoints
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and security implementation
- **Client Layer**: Communicates with external APIs (e.g., Google Books API).
- **Data Layer**: JPA repositories and entity models
- **Entities**: Domain models representing the database structure
- **DTOs**: Data Transfer Objects for request/response/filter data encapsulation
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication and authorization
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different user roles with specific permissions

The application separates domain entities from API representations using DTOs, ensuring clean data contracts and preventing entity exposure. Spring Security provides authentication with JWT tokens, enabling stateless API access with secure endpoints.

<summary><b>Class Diagram</b></summary>
Below is a UML class diagram representing the main entities and their relationships in the project:

The diagram shows the core entities (`User`, `Book`, `Author`, `Genre`, `UserBook`, `Review`, `ReadingStatus`) and how they are related.

<details>
<summary><b>Security Implementation Note</b></summary>
The security implementation (authentication and authorization) was developed with the assistance of AI tools. This part of the codebase will be refactored in the future as I enhance my knowledge of Spring Security best practices.

## üîë API Endpoints

### üîê Role-Based Access Control

The system uses role-based access control:
- `ROLE_ADMIN`: Can create, edit, and delete authors, genres, books, and users, and assign roles to other users.
- `ROLE_LIBRARIAN`: Can create, edit, and delete authors, genres, and books.
- `ROLE_USER`: Can view and search data, manage their own library and reviews.

When registering a new user, they automatically receive the `ROLE_USER` role. The first admin is created automatically when the system starts (username: `admin`, password: `admin123`).

<details>
<summary><b>üîë Authentication Endpoints</b></summary>

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login and receive JWT token

## üìñ API Documentation with Swagger

This project includes interactive API documentation generated with SpringDoc and OpenAPI 3.

Once the application is running, you can access the Swagger UI at:
`http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html`

### Authorizing Requests in Swagger UI

The Swagger UI is integrated with Spring Security, allowing you to test protected endpoints directly.

1.  First, obtain a JWT token by executing the `POST /api/auth/login` request.
2.  Click the **Authorize** button located at the top right of the Swagger UI page.
3.  In the dialog that appears, paste your token into the `Value` field, making sure to prefix it with `Bearer `. For example: `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...`
4.  Click **Authorize** and then **Close**.

After completing these steps, your requests will include the necessary `Authorization` header, and you will be able to interact with all protected endpoints.

## üß™ API Testing with Postman

This project includes a Postman collection with all the available endpoints for easy testing and exploration.

Click the button below to import the collection into your Postman application:

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.postman.com/luizdudu35/workspace/public-projects/collection/46291934-d0419c87-4271-4e71-a90a-00ba9b9aa2c3?action=share&source=copy-link&creator=46291934)

### Getting Started with Postman

1.  **Import the Collection:** Click the "Run in Postman" button above.
2.  **Set Up an Environment:** It's recommended to create a Postman Environment and add a variable for your JWT token.
3.  **Authenticate:** Run the `POST /api/auth/login` request first to get a token.
4.  **Use the Token:** Copy the token from the login response and set it as the `Bearer Token` in the "Authorization" tab for the protected requests.
